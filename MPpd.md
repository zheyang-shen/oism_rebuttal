## Reviewer MPpd:

> Quality: I find the results of this paper rather underwhelming. Their shrinkage estimator can only work for low dimensional settings, and so is, in my opinion, fairly uninteresting. For the high-dimensional setting, the heuristic assumption that the true data distribution is a product distribution is of course wildly false in practice, and indeed, will be wildly false for essentially any interesting data distribution. Other than this, most of the theory is more or less standard results, and so the only justification for this method must be from the experimental results. However, the experimental evaluation is quite shallow and only on small scale instances.

> Clarity: From a writing perspective, I am confused why the paper spends so much time in Sections 1-2, and much of Section 3.1 on what are relatively standard facts. I would suggest that the authors condense these sections.

> Significance: As described above, I am unconvinced of the significance of the method proposed.

> Originality: Much of what is described in the bulk of the paper is rather unoriginal, although the method itself to my knowledge has not been considered in the literature.

> The main question is whether the authors could justify why their methodology is meaningful, especially in the high-dimensional setting.<img width="468" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59642bd8-66ac-43ef-bc53-8591793b2a89" />
